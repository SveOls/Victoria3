states (hashmap, ID -> state) {
    pops
    owner
}

countries {
    laws
    states' key
}


pops {
    ID of location

}

hashmap(id -> pop)
hashmap(id -> state)
hashmap(id -> workplace)
hashmap(id -> religion)
hashmap(id -> culture)
hashmap(id -> country)

provinces are organized as such:

Sort by Strategic Region

Sort by State ID

Scan from bottom up, left to right.


Behavior of "{":

a "recursive" analyzer would iterate through the save file, looking for =, ={ and {. If any of these are encountered, match on the preceding info.
if the data is uninteresting, skip forward until next }. If it is interesting, pass it to relevant function with a return value. Returns upon finding }.

I could build an iterator.

i did!!!

i want to plot


culture / religion / profession / wealth / population / .....
per
capita / area / absolute
for
states / countries / (statetemplates?)
adjusted to
linear / exponential / logarithmic

so. I want a general formula that shows:

iterator(Item = (pop, state, country))
alternatively:
iterator(Item = (country, (Item = state, (Item = pop))))
.map(|(a,b,c)| (f(a), b, c))

where f(a) returns a value that can be mapped.
